After creating a base admin email managed by Terraform (using terraform.tfvars), the test files can be run in any order to manipulate update, empty/invalid test cases:

* **emptycreation.tfvars**
  * (This is used to test invalid/ empty inputs)
  * You must manually manipulate the values (comment/uncomment) to test either invalid/ empty inputs for various parameters
